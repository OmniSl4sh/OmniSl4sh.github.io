## Summary
- Mango is a great Linux box where we find a subdomain with a login page.
- Inferring the database type from the machine's name, we try for NoSQL injection and find that login page vulnerable.
- After logging in, we find the site still under construction. So we instead use the built-in regex functionality to retrieve any usernames and passwords on the web app.
- Since that process can take a long time, we create a Python script to automate the process.
- Running the script gives us credentials for two usernames: `admin` and `mango`. The `mango` user had SSH access which we used to have a shell on the box.
- When checking for SUID binaries, we come across a tool called `jjs` which we exploit with the help of GTFOBins to become `root`.
