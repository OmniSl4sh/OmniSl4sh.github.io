### Summary
- A Domain Controller machine. **Anonymous LDAP** is enabled which we use to get **a full list of AD users**.
- *After performing an* **ASREPRoast attack**, we end up with a user that has **PowerShell Remoting Access**.
- *Using* **BloodHound** *for* **Domain Enumeration**, we find that the user is member of the **Account Operators** group which *gives him the privilege of adding users to AD groups other than Domain Admins etc.*
- We add our user to a group called **'Exchange Windows Permissions'** which has a **write DACL** over the domain.
- *Abusing this privilege* lets us give ourselves the **DCSync right** over the domain using **PowerView** which *lets us grab all its NTLM hashes*
- We use the Domain *Administrator's hash* in a simple **Pass-the-Hash** attack to gain full access.

---

### Nmap
We start off doing a *comprehensive* nmap scan with **default scripts** and **service detection**

### Domain Controller Detected

We find a collection of ports that give us a high probability that this is windows machine and a domain controller:
- DNS on port 53
- Kerberos on port 88
- SMB on port 445
- LDAP on port 636
- Global Catalog on port 3268
- WinRM on port 5985

From the nmap script `smb-os-discovery`, the domain name should be `htb.local`

### Fetching a list of all AD users

We want to start enumerating users. So we use an impacket tool called `GetADUsers.py`.

The command is: `GetADUsers.py -dc-ip 10.10.10.161 "htb.local/" -all`

```

*Because LDAP Anonymous access is enabled,* this gets us **all** the users in the domain. The ones below look organic enough for us to try spraying.
- Administrator
- sebastien
- lucinda
- svc-alfresco
- andy
- mark
- santi

### Wordlist generation from common username schemes

*Since we need a wordlist,* We create a basic one from the most common passwords (like "P@ssw0rd" etc.) and from **commonly used password convention schemes** like:
- Season + Year
- Season + Year + !
- Season + Special Char + Year
- Company Name + Year
- Company Name + Year + !
- Company Name + Special Char + Year

We will pretend that `Forest` is the company name even though it's a CTF. Because that's what I would do in a real pentest :D
Also, the year this machine has been launched is 2019. So we will use that year as well as a couple of years around it (2017, 2018, 2020 and 2021).

I write a quick `PowerShell` script for this:

```
$CompanyName = "Forest"
$Seasons = 'Summer', 'Winter', 'Spring', 'Fall'
$Years = 2017..2021
$Special_Chars = '!@#$%^&*'.ToCharArray()
$Wordlist = @()

Foreach($Year in $Years){
	$Wordlist += "$CompanyName$Year"
	$Wordlist += "$CompanyName$Year!"
	Foreach($Season in $Seasons){
		$Wordlist += "$Season$Year"
		$Wordlist += "$Season$Year!"
		Foreach($Char in $Special_Chars){
			$Wordlist += "$Season$Char$Year"
			$Wordlist += "$CompanyName$Char$Year"
		}
	}
}
```

*Running that script,* I get a list of 370 passwords to try. Not bad :D

```
..SNIP..
Forest2019
Forest2019!
Summer2019
Summer2019!
Summer!2019
Forest!2019
Summer@2019
Forest@2019
Summer#2019
Forest#2019
Summer$2019
Forest$2019
Summer%2019
..SNIP..
```

### Enumerating domain password policy before password spraying

I then use `crackmapexec` to obtain the password policy. We don't want to lock everyone one out XD

![CME-Pass-Pol](/assets/Forest/CME-Pass-Pol.jpg)

We see that `Account Lockout Threshold: None` and `Domain Password Lockout Admins: 0`. This is amazing! we can definitely bruteforce without any problems :D

We start the spray using:
`crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.161 -u users.txt -p passwords.txt --continue-on-success`

But we get no luck with that :/

### ASREPRoasting

*Having no credentials,* we can still try an attack called `ASREP Roasting`. This attack would let us grab the hashes of accounts that **don't require Kerberos PreAuthentication.**

we run this attack using impacket's `GetNPUsers.py` script:

`GetNPUsers.py htb.local/ -usersfile users.txt -format hashcat -outputfile asrep-hashes.txt`

This is after we set `10.10.10.161` as our name server in `/etc/resolv.conf`. We do this because impacket does DNS lookups in the background.

![etc-resolv](/assets/Forest/etc-resolv.jpg)

![asrep-roast](/assets/Forest/asrep-roast.jpg)

notice that the user `svc-alfresco` doesn't show in the script console output. I'm not sure why xD but the hash was pushed out to the `asrep-hashes.txt` file.

### Cracking TGT with `John`

we use `john` to crack the hash and the password for `svc-alfresco` turns out to be `s3rvice`

![cracked](/assets/Forest/cracked.jpg)

*in case you were wondering,* the wordlist I used `gegalist.txt` is just one big list of all the passwords on `Seclists` (https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords) concatenated and cleaned up. I use it for all hash cracking. It's only 21,377,691 passwords. Just kidding, it's a pretty fat list XD

Alright, here is our first set of creds:
- Username: htb.local\svc-alfresco
- Password: s3rvice

### Remote Code Execution

We first try to login using `crackmapexec` using the `SMB` module. But that doesn't work. This is because `svc-alfresco` isn't a local administrator on the machine. So we try another approach for remote code execution. This time using a tool called `evil-winrm` (https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm)

![evil-winrm](/assets/Forest/evil-winrm.jpg)

it works like a charm, this is because we're a member of the builtin group of `Remote Management Users`

![groups](/assets/Forest/groups.jpg)

### Privilege Escalation

*Right after,* we get down to enumeration for privesc

1. we look for interesting files in user profiles --> nothing
2. we check for interesting directories in `c:\` --> nothing
3. we check processes --> nothing interesting there
4. we check services --> access denied
5. we run systeminfo to get information on the kernel --> access denied
6. we check for saved creds with `cmdkey /list` --> nothing
7. we check our privileges with `whoami /privs` --> nothing special there
8. we run WinPEAS (https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng) and still don't find anything

but ...

*going back to our group memberships,* we do find ourselves in quite a few interesting groups:
1. Account Operators --> this can let us create AD accounts and add them to groups other than high privilege ones (Administrators, Domain Admins etc.) (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups#bkmk-accountoperators)
2. Privileged IT Accounts --> this is not a standard AD group and we would want to know what those *Privileges* are :D
3. Service Accounts --> this too might be interesting

### Domain Enumeration with BloodHound

*since we're in a an Active Directory environment,* a standard tool to use is `BloodHound` (https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound). It can help us identify paths to escalate our privileges inside a domain context. We will use it show us what can be done using the privileges that we hold.

*in order to supply bloodhound with the information it needs,* we will need to run a tool called `SharpHound` (https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/tree/master/Collectors) to collect details about the domain.

We upload it to the machine using `evil-winrm`'s `upload` function and run it using the `-c all` flag to perform all collection methods.

![Sharphound-collection](/assets/Forest/Sharphound-collection.jpg)

We're going to transfer the data (`20220405150628_BloodHound.zip`) over to our kali machine in order to feed it to `bloodhound`.

We do that using impacket's `smbserver.py`

![smb-server](/assets/Forest/smb-server.jpg)

and then mount it on the victim machine use the `net use` command, moving the `.zip` file and then unmounting the share.

![mounting-smb](/assets/Forest/mounting-smb.jpg)

*afterwards,* we upload the file into `bloodhound` and start checking what we can do having owned the `svc-alfresco` service account. we run the `shortest path from owned principles` query:

![bloodhound-query](/assets/Forest/bloodhound-query.jpg)

This query shows us no real path to being a domain admin. So we try another query: `Shortest Paths to High Value Targets`

![bloodhound-query-2](/assets/Forest/bloodhound-query-2.jpg)

### Abusing membership in `Account Operators` & the high privileges of `Exchange Windows Permissions` AD groups

It looks horrible at first. *But, after taking a closer look,* we notice that our account *being in the* `account operators` *group* can add a member to a certain group called `Exchange Windows Permissions` which happens to have `WriteDACL` on `htb.local` (**The entire domain!**). *Having that privilege* means we can abuse it to give ourselves the `DCSync` right that we can use to dump all the domain hashes!

![path-to-DA](/assets/Forest/path-to-DA.jpg)

![abuse-write-dacl](/assets/Forest/abuse-write-dacl.jpg)

we add our user to that group using a powershell command: `Add-ADGroupMember 'Exchange Windows Permissions' -members 'svc-alfresco'`

![adding-to-group](/assets/Forest/adding-to-group.jpg)

we then upload `PowerView.ps1` (https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1) to the victim machine and import it using `import-module .\PowerView.ps1`. This enables access to all the powershell cmdlets included within that module.

### Checking the help for the `Add-DomainObjectAcl` command

we view the help page and usage examples of the abuse command `Add-DomainObjectAcl` using `Get-Help Add-DomainObjectAcl -Examples`

![abuse-command-help](/assets/Forest/abuse-command-help.jpg)

we notice that we need to create a Powershell `Credential Object` and run the command to give our user `svc-alfresco` `DCSync` rights over `htb.local`. It should be as below:

```
$SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 's3rvice'-AsPlainText -Force
$Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('HTB.local\svc-alfresco', $SecPassword)
Add-DomainObjectAcl -TargetIdentity "dc=htb,dc=local" -PrincipalIdentity 'HTB.local\svc-alfresco' -Rights DCSync -Credential $Cred -Verbose
```

This takes a little while to run but we eventually have permission to dump hashes.

### And down the hashes go...

We use impacket's `secretsdump.py` and voala! :D

![hashes_dumped](/assets/Forest/hashes_dumped.jpg)

### Pass-the-Hash for the win :)

*Using the administrator NTLM hash,* we can use `evil-winrm` to remote inside and we're done with the box :D

![got-admin](/assets/Forest/got-admin.jpg)
