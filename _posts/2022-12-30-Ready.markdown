## Summary
- Ready is a fun box where we find a Gitlab instance on port 5080.
- On the main page, we register our own user which enables us to enumerate the version.
- We find that it was vulnerable to an exploit chain of an SSRF, CRLF and Redis abuse leading to Remote Code Execution.
- After some troubleshooting to get the exploit working, we gain access as the `git` user.
- While checking the file system, we find a password inside the `/opt/backup` folder. which turned out to be for the `root` user.
- However, since we were within a Docker instance, we had one more level up to go.
- When we run `linpeas.sh`, it shows us we can mount the host's file system on our container. We do that and get the host's `root` user's private SSH key then use it remote over and own the box.
